LocalBitcoins.com was founded in 2012 by Jeremiah Kangas in Helsinki, Finland. LocalBitcoins takes a slightly different, free market approach to the buying and selling digital tokens. The platform operates as a P2P exchange that allows users to find and quickly connect with other buyers and sellers, either internationally or locally. In a way, LocalBitcoin is like the Craigslist of crypto exchanges. The platform supports all markets from around the world, allowing anyone from any country to connect with local people. This is especially helpful to those who are only legally allowed to physically transfer BTC. The platform charges a flat 1% fee on all transactions. Deals made locally with cash come with no fees. Although there are no ID requirements, it’s a good idea to verify your identity so that other traders are more likely to trust you.

LocalBitcoins Final Remarks

While a majority of people have had a positive experience with LcoalBitcoin, including the writer of this review, there are definitely scammers on the site. To stay safe, check your buyer or seller’s star ratings, make sure they’re using a verified account, and check out the forum every once in a while to block known scammers. This type of mistrust can make LocalBitcoin not the best option for traders dealing in large volumes of crypto. But, in the end LocalBitcoin is a unique and viable alternative to Coinbase – highly recommended.
